      <h1 class="article-title">I can't win the world</h1>
      <h4 class="timestamp">February 17, 2016</h4>
      <p class="observation">I can tell myself all day that I'm not trying to win the world, that I'm not trying to gain the approval of my colleagues.  Yet my heart secretly yearns for it.</p>
      <p class="observation">God warned His own elect people that...</p>
      <blockquote>The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately sick; who can understand it?<br /><cite>Jeremiah 17:9</cite></blockquote>
      <p class="observation">The hard part is saying "no" to my heart.  Because from the same deceitful heart also comes a type of pride that says, "I am both too proud and too scared to talk to God about this; something else will restore my happiness."  That is yet another lie.</p>
      <p class="observation">Thankfully, Jeremiah's intervention a few verses later for a wandering nation is just as applicable today to the wandering Christian heart:</p>
      <blockquote>Heal me, O Lord, and I shall be healed; save me, and I shall be saved, for you are my praise.<br /><cite>Jeremiah 17:14</cite></blockquote>

      <h1 class="article-title">A prayer, for when I forget God</h1>
      <h4 class="timestamp">January 31, 2016</h4>
      <p class="prayer">My heart wanders, O Father. It desires the things of this life; they bring only fleeting
        pleasure before flooding the heart with hopelessness and emptiness.</p>

      <p class="prayer">Restore to me the joy of Your salvation, and uphold me with a willing spirit.</p>

      <p class="prayer-closing">By the mercies of Christ, Amen.</p>
